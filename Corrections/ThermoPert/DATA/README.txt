This folder contains data files with corrections from NN to MB-pol calculated by
by thermodynamic pertubation.

[ice]-pert-corr.dat: correction to chemical potential difference going from liquid to ice
 for each pressure and temperature and associated error.

[ice]_[ice,Liq]-pert-corr.dat: correction for either ice or liquid for each pressure and temperature and associated error.
